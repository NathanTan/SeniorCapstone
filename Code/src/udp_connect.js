UDP Connect

For the following to work, both the server the Raspberry Pi need to be
connected to a common, local network.

When the server and RPi is turned on, there needs to be a way for the server
and the RPi to become aware of eachothers IP addresses.

One way to establish connection is by updating host IP addresses manually,
for both the server and RPi code. This is not user-friendly, especially when you
know that the MAV is going to be operated from different networks.

To determine the IP addresses, the following protocol is established:
1. Upon booting up, the RPi initiates a UDP broadcast listener, for a
    maximum of 60 seconds. The listener receives a broadcast at a certain port,
    known to both the server and the RPi.
2. When the server is launched, the server broadcasts a special message, to the
    known port. The message is broadcasted every 0.5 secods, for a maximum of 60
    seconds.
3. The server also starts a listener, to acquire a response from the RPi.
4. Upon receiving a broadcast messsage from the server, the RPi saves the IP
    address of the server, stops the listener, and initiates a sender UDP, with
    now the host IP addresss of the server.
4. The RPi sends a response,
