\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document establishes definite project requirements of the CS team’s portion of the Vertical Flight Society’s (VFS) micro air vehicle (MAV) obstacle course challenge. Each requirement is described in detail.

\subsection{Scope}
This document is constrained to the CS team’s work on the MAV. These top-level features are the focus:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Display of onboard cameras and sensors
    \item Obstacle detection and avoidance
    \item Helipad target recognition
    \item Digital flight controls
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Product Overview}
This document covers the interactions between: the different features, how users are supposed to interact with the team’s MAV, assumptions made by the team, and the constraints faced by the team.

\subsubsection{Product Perspective}
The MAV will transmit sensor data, which the CS team’s software will capture and process. The software will use the data to make flight control decisions and then transmit the orders to the MAV. The software will provide a level of semi-autonomous control, but fall short of a fully autonomous system. The software exists to help the pilot, not to fly the craft.
\subsubsection{Product Functions}
The MAV will have a dedicated computer that handles data processing and flight controls. Computer software will process incoming camera and sensory information and provide the pilot with visual, and potentially auditory, feedback. Feedback includes coordination of helipad targets and obstacle warning detection. Particular information, regarding collision avoidance in particular, will be transmitted back to the MAV for flight control override.
\subsubsection{User Characteristics}
The MAV is controlled remotely by an experienced pilot. Visual display, pickup assist, and obstacle warning system will provide the pilot with additional information to navigate the MAV.

\subsubsection{Limitations}
The competition and the MAV should conform to the rules established by the Vertical Flight Society, which enforce safety considerations, inclusion of remote control functionality, a 500 gram weight limit, a 45 centimeter dimension limit in any direction, and inclusion of an onboard camera. The 500 gram weight limit and budget limitations prevent the use of desired hardware, including Intel RealSense camera, laser scanner, laser range finders, high bandwidth broadcasting equipment, and powerful onboard processing units.

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
This gantt chart describes our estimated timeline of completing tasks. Each phase needs to be completed by the end of it’s width. Documents for the grade portion of this project are due by the end of each term, denoted by the green bars. In terms of the CS team, code for the various helicopter components should be feature complete by the end of winter term.

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Computer Vision}: A subset of artificial intelligence that deals with providing information through visual and image data.
    \item \textbf{Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)}: A type of Neural Network that has learnable weights and biases that help to inference the data better. A CNN learns from each raw pixel from an image and assigns new weights to the convolution layer.
    \item \textbf{Convolutional Layer}: A layer of a CNN that performs the computations.
    \item \textbf{Dropout Layer}: A layer of the CNN that prevents overfitting of data.
    \item \textbf{Micro Air Vehicle (MAV)}: A remotely controlled, semi-autonomous, coaxial helicopter.
    \item \textbf{Package}: A sealed paper lunch bag, containing a pamphlet. A braided wire loop is attached at the top of the bag for acquirement.
    \item \textbf{Package A}: A package weighing between 20 and 25 grams.
    \item \textbf{Package B}: A package weighing between 25 and 30 grams.

\subsection{Competition Walkthrough}
The MAV must complete a mission that is themed as Washington’s Flight for Liberty. The MAV's mission performance is the standard to which the OSU team's software will be held. Objectives of the mission are described below (please refer to Figure 1 for the visual):
\begin{enumerate}
\item The mission begins with the MAV parked at Thomas Paine’s helipad. Upon the start of a ten minute timer, the MAV must do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take off from the helipad.
\item Hover for ten seconds.
\item Acquire Package A.
\item Hover for ten seconds.
\item Fly North until reached the net barrier.
\end{enumerate}
\item Upon reaching the the barrier, the pilot must:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Climb MAV 1.83 meters, plus a safe height, above the barrier.
\item Spot and verbally express visual contact with McKonkey’s Ferry.
\item Fly north, descending to a safe height, until reached and passed the center line of McKonkey’s Ferry, by approximately 0.5 meters.
\end{enumerate}
\item Once within 0.91 meters from the northern side of McKonkey’s Ferry, the MAV must head east, until crossed Delaware River and reached Pamphlet Delivery helipad.
\item At Pamphlet Delivery helipad, the MAV must release the package, as close to the bullseye as possible.
\item After releasing the package, the pilot must maneuver MAV south, to Camp Washington Pickup Zone. On its way, the MAV must:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fly over a 1.22 meter high barrier.
\item Fly under a 0.61 meter obstacle.
\end{enumerate}
\item At the Camp Washington Pickup Zone, the MAV must:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Acquire Package B.
\item Hover for ten seconds.
\item Head back to Thomas Paine’s helipad, reversing the route.
\end{enumerate}
\item Upon reaching Thomas Paine’s helipad, the pilot must:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Verbally express visual contact with Thomas Paine’s helipad.
\item Have the MAV release the package as close to the bullseye as possible.
\item Land the MAV within 0.91 meters of the helipad.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Verification}
Measurement is done by the qualitative assessment of mission phases described below:
\begin{description}
\item[Take off and Hover] The MAV must perform a stable hover, above base, at a height of two meters.
\item[En Route to Delivery/Pickup Area] The MAV must have a clearly-announced, timed, and smooth transition to the package delivery and package pick up sites.
\item[Obstacle Avoidance]The MAV must avoid obstacles between the home base the target search area. Metrics include successful avoidance and smoothness of flight around obstacles.
\item[Target Acquisition] The MAV must establish a stable hover for at least five seconds over each delivery/pickup location target and smoothly transition between searching, hover, and drop-off/pickup phases. Metrics include lateral target tracking error and stable roll/pitch performance.
\item[En Route Return to Base] The MAV must return to base with a user signal. Remote operator can use LOS. "Base" can use homing beacons for autonomous return to base. Metrics include qualitative smoothness of transitions and time to acquire stable hover over base.
\item[Hover and Landing] The MAV must acquire a stable hover, two meters above base, before landing. Metrics include hover and landing performance, as well as, distance from the center of the helipad.
