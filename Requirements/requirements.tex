\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document establishes definite project requirements of the Computer Science team\textquotesingle s portion of the Vertical Flight Society\textquotesingle s Micro Air Vehicle obstacle course challenge. Each requirement is described in detail.

\subsection{Scope}
This document is constrained to the CS team’s work on the MAV. The primary focus for our project is to build an aviation user interface to display data feeds from the onboard cameras and sensors. The software is intended for the MAV pilot to use during the competition.

\subsection{Product Overview}
This document covers the interactions between the different features, how users are supposed to interact with the team’s MAV, assumptions made by the team, and the constraints faced by the team.

\subsubsection{Product Perspective}
The MAV will transmit sensor data, which the CS team’s software will capture and process. The software is intended for the pilot to use while flying the aircraft to help create informed flight control decisions. The software displays data feeds from flight sensors including speed, height, vehicle orientation, and two cameras onboard the helicopter. Additionally, the software is built with a scalable framework which allows for new data feeds to be added with ease.

\subsubsection{Product Functions}
The MAV will have a dedicated laptop computer that handles data processing and flight controls. Computer software will process incoming camera and sensory information and provide the pilot with visual feedback.

\subsubsection{User Characteristics}
The MAV is controlled remotely by an experienced pilot. A visual display with camera and sensor data will provide the pilot with additional information to help guide the pilot when the MAV is out of line of sight..

\subsubsection{Limitations}
The competition and the MAV should conform to the rules established by the Vertical Flight Society, which enforce safety considerations, inclusion of remote control functionality, a 500 gram weight limit, a 45 centimeter dimension limit in any direction, and inclusion of an onboard camera. The 500 gram weight limit and budget limitations prevent the use of desired hardware, including an \textit{Eys3D} camera, certain types of range finding sensors, high bandwidth broadcasting equipment, and powerful on-board processing units.

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
Figure \ref{fig:GanttChart} is a Ghantt chart that describes our estimated timeline of completing tasks. Each phase needs to be completed by the end of it’s width. Documents for the grade portion of this project are due by the end of each term, denoted by the green bars. In terms of the CS team, code for the various helicopter components should be feature complete by the end of winter term.

\subsection{Competition Walkthrough}
The MAV must complete an obstacle course mission themed as Washington\textquotesingle s Flight for Liberty. Figure \ref{fig:CourseMap} displays a mock-up of an obstacle course. Step-by-step objectives of an obstacle course are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The mission begins with the MAV parked at Thomas Paine’s helipad. Upon the start of a ten minute timer, the MAV must do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take off from the helipad.
\item Hover for ten seconds.
\item Acquire Package A.
\item Hover for ten seconds.
\item Fly North until reached the net barrier.
\end{enumerate}
\item Upon reaching the the barrier, the pilot must:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Climb MAV 1.83 meters, plus a safe height, above the barrier.
\item Spot and verbally express visual contact with McKonkey’s Ferry.
\item Fly north, descending to a safe height, until reached and passed the center line of McKonkey’s Ferry, by approximately 0.5 meters.
\end{enumerate}
\item Once within 0.91 meters from the northern side of McKonkey’s Ferry, the MAV must head east, until crossed Delaware River and reached Pamphlet Delivery helipad.
\item At Pamphlet Delivery helipad, the MAV must release the package, as close to the bullseye as possible.
\item After releasing the package, the pilot must maneuver MAV south, to Camp Washington Pickup Zone. On its way, the MAV must:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fly over a 1.22 meter high barrier.
\item Fly under a 0.61 meter obstacle.
\end{enumerate}
\item At the Camp Washington Pickup Zone, the MAV must:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Acquire Package B.
\item Hover for ten seconds.
\item Head back to Thomas Paine’s helipad, reversing the route.
\end{enumerate}
\item Upon reaching Thomas Paine’s helipad, the pilot must:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Verbally express visual contact with Thomas Paine’s helipad.
\item Have the MAV release the package as close to the bullseye as possible.
\item Land the MAV within 0.91 meters of the helipad.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Verification}
Measurement is done by the qualitative assessment of mission phases described below:
\begin{description}
\item[Take off and Hover] The MAV must perform a stable hover, above base, at a height of two meters.
\item[En Route to Delivery/Pickup Area] The MAV must have a clearly-announced, timed, and smooth transition to the package delivery and package pick up sites.
\item[Obstacle Avoidance]The MAV must avoid obstacles between the home base the target search area. Metrics include successful avoidance and smoothness of flight around obstacles.
\item[Target Acquisition] The MAV must establish a stable hover for at least five seconds over each delivery/pickup location target and smoothly transition between searching, hover, and drop-off/pickup phases. Metrics include lateral target tracking error and stable roll/pitch performance.
\item[En Route Return to Base] The MAV must return to base with a user signal. Remote operator can use LOS. "Base" can use homing beacons for autonomous return to base. Metrics include qualitative smoothness of transitions and time to acquire stable hover over base.
\item[Hover and Landing] The MAV must acquire a stable hover, two meters above base, before landing. Metrics include hover and landing performance, as well as, distance from the center of the helipad.
